Please make sure that you go through [Leaflet.FreeDraw](https://github.com/Wildhoney/Leaflet.FreeDraw) readme before integrating this component.

You need to wrap this component into MapContainer component and pass the options as shown below.

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { MapContainer } from 'react-leaflet';
import Freedraw, { ALL } from 'react-leaflet-freedraw';

const Component = () => {
  const freedrawRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <MapContainer>
      <Freedraw
        mode={ALL}
        eventHandlers={{
          markers: (event) =>
            console.log(
              'markers drawn - latLngs',
              event.latLngs,
              'Polygons:',
              freedrawRef.current.size()
            ),
          mode: (event) => console.log('mode changed', event),
        }}
        ref={freedrawRef}
      />
    </MapContainer>
  );
};
```

It supports all the options mentioned in [Leaflet.FreeDraw](https://github.com/Wildhoney/Leaflet.FreeDraw).
